# 💫 Portfolio Website Project

A modern portfolio web application built with the **Front-end Technologies** — [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) with [Vite](https://vite.dev/). Styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a sleek, responsive, mobile-first UI and [React Bits](https://www.reactbits.dev/) for smooth animations.

This project showcases my ability to build scalable, real-world web applications with clean code architecture, intuitive design, and modern development best practices. It serves as my personal portfolio website, designed to introduce who I am as a developer, highlight the projects I’ve worked on, and share my skills, experiences, and professional journey.

- About Me – A quick overview of my background and passion for development
- Projects – A showcase of selected work with links to GitHub and live demos
- Skills – Technologies and tools I specialize in
- Experience & Education – Highlights of my academic and professional milestones
- Contact – A form and links to connect with me via LinkedIn, email, or GitHub

This portfolio is not just a static site. it's a living project that I continue to improve as I grow professionally. It’s also a place where visitors (recruiters, collaborators, or fellow developers) can get a genuine sense of my approach to development, design, and communication.
